# Zomato Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project explores the Zomato dataset to analyze dining and restaurant trends. The analysis focuses on customer preferences, voting patterns, and the impact of online and offline orders on restaurant ratings.

## Key Findings
- **Voting Trends**: Dining restaurants received the most votes, indicating high customer engagement and popularity.
- **Rating Distribution**: The majority of restaurant ratings fall between 3.75 and 4.00, suggesting a generally positive customer experience.
- **Cost Preferences**: Most couples prefer restaurants with an approximate cost ranging from ₹200 to ₹300, highlighting budget considerations for dining out.
- **Order Preferences**: Offline orders tend to receive lower ratings compared to online orders, indicating a potential area for improvement in offline service quality.
- **Order Type Analysis**: Dining restaurants primarily accept offline orders, while cafes mainly receive online orders. This suggests that customers prefer to order in person at traditional dining establishments but opt for online ordering at cafes.
